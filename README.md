**Object Relationships**      </br>

There are many different kinds of relationships two objects may have in real-life, and we use specific “relation type” words to describe these relationships.         </br>
For instance:                </br>

-A square "is-a" shape                              </br>
-A car "has-a" steering wheel                       </br>
-A computer programmer "uses-a" keyboard            </br>
-A flower "depends-on" a bee (for pollination)      </br>
-A student "member-of" a class                      </br>
-Your brain exists as "part-of" you                 </br>
