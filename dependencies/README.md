**DEPENDENCIES**

In casual conversation, we use the term dependency to indicate that an object is reliant upon another object for a given task. 
For example, if you break your foot, you are dependent on crutches to get around (but not otherwise).</br>
Flowers are dependent upon bees to pollinate them, in order to grow fruit or propagate (but not otherwise).</br></br>

A dependency occurs when one object invokes another objectâ€™s functionality in order to accomplish some specific task. 
This is a weaker relationship than an association, but still, any change to object being depended upon may break 
functionality in the (dependent) caller.
A dependency is always a unidirectional relationship.
